# DESCRIPTION OF TASKS
---
This task involved designing a voice-controlled user interface for a smart home assistant application. The primary focus was on creating an intuitive and accessible way for users to interact with home devices using voice commands like:

“Turn off bedroom lights”

“Set temperature to 22°C”

“Play music in kitchen”

🗣️ Voice Interaction System
The interface features a central microphone control with a large tap-to-speak button and a speech animation indicator. Below it, sample commands guide first-time users for natural interaction.

📱 UI Components & Device Controls:
The app dashboard lists all smart devices in a card-based layout under “Your Devices”, each offering real-time control:

Main Lights (Living Room) – Brightness adjustable via slider

Bedroom Lights – On/Off switch

Smart TV – Volume slider

Kitchen Lights – Brightness control

Thermostat – Temperature setting (22°C with slider)

Front Door (Offline) – Displays status and disables control when offline

Each device is visually distinguished by:

Iconography

Room labels

Status indicators: Online/Offline badges

🌙 Additional Features:
Device Connectivity Count: Top-right shows how many devices are online

Dark mode toggle (assumed from moon icon)

Help button for user guidance

Unified visual system using shades of violet and clear icon sets for consistency

🧠 UX Considerations:
Clear, single-action voice prompt area

Responsive sliders and toggles for quick manual overrides

Color-coded device status (e.g., red for offline)

High accessibility contrast and friendly layout
